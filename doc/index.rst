The interaction-expansion solver
================================

The :ref:`TRIQS-based <triqslibs:welcome>` interaction-expansion
solver allows to solve the problem of a quantum impurity embedded in a
conduction bath. For now, it is restrictued to density-density interaction
vertices.

Learn how to use it in the :ref:`documentation`.
