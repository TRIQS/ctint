Computation of g2w (three-point function) in CTINT and CTHYB
-------------------------------------------------------------

The three scripts do the following computation

1) g2w from cthyb_spin
2) g2w from ctint by operator insertion
3) g2w from ctint from M4t measurement

At the moment, 1) and 2) give exactly the same result, 3) is slightly off for up|down real component.

2) is slow.
